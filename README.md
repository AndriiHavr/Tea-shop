This is a tea shop website project where I am practicing my HTML, CSS(mostly), JS skills.
Additionally, I have added responsiveness to the site(without it in our time no way).

You may check this site use [this link](https://eclipseandrew.github.io/Tea-shop/) 
Also if you whant to compare with template I leave for you a [link on a template]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmhE-n05AVMBFBTX9xCi4WAykIBZFVN-/view?usp=sharing).

 "The road appears under the feet of the one who walks" - I hope so.
